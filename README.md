# `columbus`

![The current state of Columbus](./images/columbus-sample.png)

A Terminal User Interface(TUI) file explorer created in `Ratatui` and `Rust`.

**Note:** The project is still in development and is not usable yet.

## Why `columbus`?

`columbus` is created as a TUI file explorer that looks like a normal GUI file manager that most of the people are used too. This way people can use a full fledged powerful file explorer directly from their terminal instead of hopping between apps every single time.

## Features that `columbus` offers

**Note:** The project is still under development and most (if not all) of the underlying features may not be implemented. 

1. A more familiar User interface 
2. Screen segregated into 
    * Explorer
    * Path Field
    * Drives
    * Quick Access
    * Command bar
3. Can open applications on `enter` based on the commands provided in configuration files. (Have not even started to work on it 🥲).
